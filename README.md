### What is Ansible

Ansible is an open source IT automation tool that automates your IT environment for provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, and many other manual IT processes.

Ansible is,

- **Simple** - commands and playbook are human readable and easy to exchange between teams; you don;t need any special skills to read it.
- **Powerful** - you can manage application/patch/server deployment, configuration, workflow automation, etc.
- **Agentless** - Ansible does not need any agent to be running on the managed hosts, instead it connects to the hosts using OpenSSH or WinRM.
